## Visualize easily how your investments are projected to develop in the future.

 A simple script that illustrates the importance of compound interest,
 a long term perspective for wealth creation and the advantage
 of a large initial investment.

### Project the growth of wealth
 This Python script can help to plan wealth creation over longer periods.
 To calculate the expected development of the assets,
 the script asks for the initial investment, the planned monthly contributions,
 the expected yearly return in percent,
 and the time frame in months. On this basis, the expected total wealth,
 the total investment profit, and the monthly income from the investment
 for every month within the time frame will be calculated.

### Easy data input and coprehensive visualization
 Relying on the Streamlit library, the GUI for data input and visualization,
 a graph will be shown that illustrates the growth of total wealth
 and investment profit. Beyond that, you can inspect detailed data 
 for every month and download a CSV file. 

 The script currently does not take inflation into consideration.
