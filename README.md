### Visualize the Future Growth of Your Investments

Easily visualize how your investments are projected to develop in the future with this simple Python script. The script helps you plan wealth creation over longer periods by calculating the expected total wealth, total investment profit, and monthly income from the investment based on initial investment, planned monthly contributions, expected yearly return, and time frame.

### GUI for Data Input and Visualization

The script uses the Streamlit library to provide a GUI for data input and visualization. This includes a graph that illustrates the growth of total wealth and investment profit, as well as detailed data for every month. You can also download a CSV file with all of the data.

### Considerations

Please note that the script currently does not take inflation into consideration.
