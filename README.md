# Zinseszins
 A simple script that illustrates the importance of compound interest and
 a long term perspective for wealth creation.

 This Python script can help to plan wealth creation over longer periods.
 To calculate the expected development of the assets the script asks for
 the initial investment, the planned monthly contributions, the expected
 yearly return in percent and the time frame in months. On this basis a report
 for every month will be printed that shows the expected total wealth,
 the total investment profit and the monthly income from the investment at that
 point in time.

 Relying on the Matplotlib library a graph will be shown that illustrates
 the growth of total wealth and investment profit.

 The script currently does not take inflation into consideration. However this
 flaw could be circumvented by subtracting the expected yearly inflation rate
 from the expected yearly return in percent.
